# 609 - Am I a Soldier of the Cross
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
Am I a soldier of the cross,   
A follower of the Lamb,  
And shall I fear to own his cause,   
Or blush to speak his name?     

**2**  
Must I be carried to the skies  
On flowery beds of ease,  
While others fought to win the prize,  
And sailed through bloody seas?      

**3**   
Are there no foes for me to face?  
Must I not stem the flood?  
Is this vile world a friend to grace,  
To help me on to God?

**4**  
Sure I must fight, if I would reign;  
Increase my courage, Lord  
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,  
Supported by thy word

**5**  
Thy saints in all this glorious war  
Shall conquer though they die;  
They see the triumph from afar,  
By faith they bring it nigh

**6**  
When that illustrious day shall rise,  
And all thy armies shine  
In robes of victory through the skies,  
The glory shall be thine
