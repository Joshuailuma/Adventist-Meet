# 304 - Faith of Our Fathers
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Faith of our fathers! living still  
In spite of dungeon, fire, and sword,  
O how our hearts beat high with joy  
Whene'er we hear that glorious word.  
Faith of our fathers! holy faith!  
We will be true to thee till death.
 
   
**2**  
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,  
Were still in heart and conscience free;  
How sweet would be their children's fate,  
If they, like them, could die for thee!  
Faith of our fathers! holy faith!  
We will be true to thee till death.    

**3**  
Faith of our fathers! we will love  
Both friend and foe in all our strife,  
And preach thee, too, as love knows how,  
By kindly words and virtuous life.  
Faith of our fathers! holy faith!  
We will be true to thee till death.
