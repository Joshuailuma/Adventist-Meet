# 630 - Rise, My Soul, and Stretch Thy Wings
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,  
Thy better portion trace;  
Rise from transitory things  
Toward heaven, thy native place:  
Sun, and moon, and stars decay;  
Time shall soon this earth remove;  
Rise, my soul, and haste away  
To seats prepared above.  

**2**  
Rivers to the ocean run,  
Nor stay in all their course;  
Fire ascending seeks the sun;  
Both speed them to their source;  
So a soul that's born of God,  
Longs to view His glorious face,  
Forward tends to His abode  
To rest in His embrace.  

**3**  
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn;  
Press onward to the prize;  
Soon our Savior will return,  
Triumphant in the skies;  
Yet a season, and you know  
Happy entrance will be given,  
All our sorrows left below,  
And earth exchanged for heaven.
