# 312 - Near the Cross
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Jesus, keep me near the cross;  
There a precious fountain  
Free to all, a healing stream,  
Flows from Calvary's mountain.   


### Refrain  
In the cross, in the cross,  
Be my glory ever,  
Till my raptured soul shall find  
Rest beyond the river.
   
**2**  
Near the cross, a trembling soul,  
Love and mercy found me;  
There the bright and Morning Star  
Sheds its beams around me.  

**3**  
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,  
Bring its scenes before me;  
Help me walk from day to day,  
With its shadows o'er me. 

**4**  
Near the cross I'll watch and wait,  
Hoping, trusting ever,  
Till I reach the golden strand,  
Just beyond the river.
