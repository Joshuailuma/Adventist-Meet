# 367 - Rescue the Perishing
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,  
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;  
Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,  
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save. 


### Refrain  
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;  
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
   
**2**  
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,  
Waiting the penitent child to receive;  
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;  
He will forgive if they only believe.  

**3**  
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;  
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;  
Back to the narrow way patiently win them; 
Tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
