# 387 - Come O Sabbath Day
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Come, O Sabbath day, and bring  
Peace and healing on thy wing;  
And to every troubled breast  
Speak of the divine behest:  
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!  

**2**  
Earthly longings bid retire,  
Quench the passions' hurtful fire;  
To the wayward, sin oppressed,  
Bring thou thy divine behest:  
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!   

**3**  
Wipe from every cheek the tear,  
Banish care and silence fear;  
All things working for the best,  
Teach us the divine behest:  
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
