# 171 - Thine Is the Glory
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Thine is the glory,  
Risen, conquering Son;  
Endless is the vict'ry  
Thou o'er death hast won.  
Angels in bright raiment  
Rolled the stone away,  
Kept the folded graveclothes  
Where Thy body lay. 


### Refrain  
Thine is the glory,  
Risen, conquering Son;  
Endless is the vict'ry  
Thou o'er death hast won. 

**2**  
Lo! Jesus meets us,  
Risen, from the tomb;  
Lovingly He greets us,  
Scatters fear and gloom;  
Let His church with gladness  
Hymns of triumph sing,  
For her Lord now liveth;  
Death hath lost its sting.  

**3**  
No more we doubt Thee,  
Glorious Prince of Life!  
Life is naught without Thee;  
Aid us in our strife;  
Make us more than conqu'rors,  
Through Thy deathless love;  
Bring us safe through Jordan  
With Thy power and love.
