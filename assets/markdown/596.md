# 596 - Look for the Waymarks
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**    
Look for the waymarks as you journey on,  
Look for the waymarks passing one by one;  
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four;  
Where are we standing?  
Look the waymarks o'er. 


### Refrain  
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic waymarks,  
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.  
Look for the way marks, the great prophetic waymarks;  
The journey's almost o'er. 

**2**  
First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,  
Then MedoPersia's banners were unfurled;  
And after Greece held universal sway,  
Rome seized the scepter;  
Where are we today?         

**3**   
Down in the feet of iron and of clay,  
Weak and divided, soon to pass away;  
What will the next great, glorious drama be?  
Christ and His coming,
