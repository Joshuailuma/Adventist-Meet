# 350 - Blest Be the Tie That Binds
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Blest be the tie that binds  
Our hearts in Christian love;  
The fellowship of kindred minds  
Is like to that above.
    
**2**  
Before our Father’s throne  
We pour our ardent prayers;  
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,  
Our comforts and our cares.

**3**  
We share each other’s woes,  
Our mutual burdens bear;  
And often for each other flows  
The sympathizing tear.

**4**  
When we asunder part,  
It gives us inward pain;  
But we shall still be joined in heart,  
And hope to meet again.
