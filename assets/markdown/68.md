## Key G Major
                                                          
                                                          
**1**  
On our way rejoicing Gladly let us go;  
Conquer’d hath our Leader,  
Vanquish’d is the foe.  
Christ without, our safety; Christ within,
our joy;  
Who, if we be faithful, Can our hope destroy?  


### Refrain  
On our way rejoicing,  
As we forward move,  
Hearken to our praises,  
O blest God of love!

**2**  
Unto God the Father, joyful songs we sing,  
Unto God the Saviour,  
Thankful hearts we bring,  
Unto God the Spirit, bow we and adore,  
On our way rejoicing, now and evermore.

**3**  
God be with you till we meet again;  
When life’s perils thick confound you;  
Put His arms unfailing round you;  
God be with you till we meet again.

**4**  
God be with you till we meet again;  
Keep love’s banner floating over you,  
Strike death’s threatening wave before you;  
God be with you till we meet again.
