# 537 - He Leadeth Me
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
He leadeth me! O blessed thought!  
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!  
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,  
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.   


### Refrain  
He leadeth me, He leadeth me,  
By His own hand He leadeth me;  
His faithful follower I would be,  
For by His hand He leadeth me.    

**2**  
Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,  
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom  
By waters still, o'er troubled sea;  
Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me!  

**3**  
Lord, I would clasp my hand in Thine,  
Nor ever murmur nor repine;  
Content, whatever lot I see,  
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me. 

**4**  
And when my task on earth is done,  
When, by Thy grace, the victory's won,  
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,  
E'en decath's cold wave I will not flee,  
E'en decath's cold wave I will not flee,  
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.
