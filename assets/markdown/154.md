# 154 - When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of glory died,  
My richest gain I count but loss,  
And pour contempt on all my pride.  

**2**  
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,  
Save in the death of Christ, my God;  
All the vain things that charm me most  
I sacrifice them to His blood.    

**3**  
See, from His head, His hands, His feet,  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:  
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?  

**4**  
Were the whole realm of nature mine,  
That were a present far too small;    
Love so amazing, so divine,  
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
