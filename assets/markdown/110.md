**1**  
God’s free mercy streameth  
Over all the world,  
And His banner gleameth,  
By His church unfurled;  
Broad and deep and glorious,  
As the heavens above,  
Shines in might victorious  
His eternal love.
                                                          
**2**  
Summer suns are glowing  
Over land and sea;  
Happy light is flowing,  
Bountiful and free;  
Everything rejoices  
In the mellow rays;  
Earth’s ten thousand voices  
Swell the psalm of praise.

**3**  
Lord, upon our blindness  
Thy pure radiance pour;   
For Thy loving-kindness  
We would love Thee more;  
And when clouds are drifting  
Dark across the sky,  
Then, veil uplifting,  
Father, be Thou nigh.

**4**  
We will never doubt Thee,  
Tho’ Thou veil the light;  
Life is dark without Thee,  
Death with Thee is bright.  
Light of light, shine o’er us  
On our pilgrim way,  
Go Thou still before us  
To the endless day.
