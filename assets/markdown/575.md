# 575 - Let Your Heart Be Broken 
-------------------
## Key D Minor


**1**    
Let your heart be broken  
For a world in need:  
Feed the mouths that hunger,  
Soothe the wounds that bleed,  
Give the cup of water  
And the loaf of bread  
Be the hands of Jesus,  
Serving in His stead.  

**2**  
Here on earth applying  
Principles of love,  
Visible expression-  
God still rules above-  
Living illustration  
Of the Living Word  
To the minds of all who've  
Never seen or heard.  

**3**  
Blest to be a blessing,  
Privilege to care,  
Challenged by the need-  
Apparent everywhere.  
Where mankind is wanting,  
Fill the vacant place.  
Be the means through which the  
Lord reveals his Grace.  

**4**  
Add to your believing  
Deeds that prove it true,  
Knowing Christ as Savior,  
Make Him Master, too  
Follow in His footsteps,  
Go where He has trod;  
In the world's great trouble  
Risk yourself for God.
