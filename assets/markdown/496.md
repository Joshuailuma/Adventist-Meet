# 496 - Eternal Love, We Have No Good
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
Eternal Love, we have no good to bring Thee,  
No single good of all our hands have wrought,  
No worthy music have we found to sing Thee,  
No jewelled word, no quick up soaring thought.

**2**  
And yet we come; and when our faith would falter  
Show us, O Love, the quiet place of prayer,  
The golden censer and the golden altar,  
And the great angel waiting for us there.

**3**  
“We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling,  
Which for long years we did rejoice to see;  
The blessings of this sinful world are failing;  
We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.

**4**  
“We would see Jesus; this is all we’re needing-  
Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;  
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,  
Soon to return and end this mortal night!
