# 561 - We Plow the Fields
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**    
We plow the fields and scatter  
The good seed on the land,  
But it is fed and watered  
By God's almighty hand.  
He sends the snow in winter,  
The warmth to swell the grain,  
The breezes and the sunshine,  
And soft, refreshing rain.   


### Refrain  
All good gifts around us  
Are sent from heaven above;  
Then thank the Lord,  
O thank the Lord  
For all His love. 

**2**  
He only is the Maker  
Of all things near and far;  
He paints the wayside flower,  
He lights the evening star.  
The winds and waves obey Him,  
By Him the birds are fed;  
Much more, to us His children,  
He gives our daily bread.  

**3**   
We thank Thee then, O Father,  
For all things bright and good:  
The seedtime and the harvest,  
Our life, our health, our food.  
Accept the gifts we offer  
For all Thy love imparts,  
And, what Thou most desirest,  
Our humble, thankful hearts.
