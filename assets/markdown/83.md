**1**  
O worship the King, all glorious above,  
O gratefully sing His wonderful love;  
Our shield and defender, the Ancient of days,  
Pavilioned in splendour, and girded with praise.

**2**  
O tell of his might, O sing of His grace,  
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space;  
His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form,  
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

**3**  
Thy bountiful care, what tongue can recite?  
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light;  
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,  
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.

**4**  
Frail children of the dust, and feeble as frail,  
In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail;  
Thy mercies, how tender! how firm to the end!  
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!
