# 373 - Seeking the Lost
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
Seeking the lost; yes, kindly entreating  
Wanderers on the mountain astray;  
"Come unto Me," His message repeating,  
Words of the Master speaking today.


### Refrain  
Going afar upon the mountain,  
Bringing the wand'rer back again, back again,  
Into the fold of my Redeemer,  
Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain, for sinners slain.  
   
**2**  
Seeking the lost; and pointing to Jesus  
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,  
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,  
Showing the path to life evermore.    

**3**  
Thus I would go on missions of mercy,  
Following Christ from day unto day,  
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,  
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.
