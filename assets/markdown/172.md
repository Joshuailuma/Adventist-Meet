Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!  
The strife is o'er, the battle done;   
Now is the victor's triumph won!  
Now be the song of praise begun.  
Alleluia!  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

The pow'rs of death have done their worst,  
But Christ their legions has dispersed.  
Let shouts of holy joy outburst.  
Alleluia!

The three sad days have quickly sped,  
He rises glorious from the dead.  
All glory to our risen head!  
Alleluia!

Lord, by the stripes which wounded You,  
From death's sting free Your servants too,  
That we may live and sing to You.  
Alleluia!
