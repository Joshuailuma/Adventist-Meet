# 519 - Give to the Winds Your Fears
-------------------
## Key G Minor


**1**    
Give to the winds your fears;  
In hope be undismayed:    
God hears your sighs and counts your tears,  
God shall lift up your head.     

**2**  
To Him commit your griefs;  
Your ways put in His hands  
To His sure truth and tender care  
Who earth and heaven commands.   

**3**   
O put your trust in God;  
In duty's path go on.  
Walk in His strength with faith and hope,  
So shall your work be done. 

**4** 
Leave to His sovereign sway  
To choose and to command;  
So you shall, faithful, seek His way  
How wise, how strong His hand!
