# 167 - Alleluia Sing to Jesus
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Alleluia! sing to Jesus!  
His the scepter, His the throne;  
Alleluia! His the triumph,  
His the victory alone;  
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion  
Thunder like a mighty flood;  
Jesus out of every nation  
Hath redeemed us by His blood.   
    

**2**  
Alleluia! not as orphans  
Are we left in sorrow now;  
Alleluia! He is near us,  
Faith believes, nor questions how:  
Though the cloud from sight received Him,  
When the forty days were o'er,  
Shall our hearts forget His promise,   
"I am with you evermore"? 

**3**  
Alleluia! Bread of heaven,  
Thou on earth our food, our stay!  
Alleluia! here the sinful  
Flee to Thee from day to day:  
Intercessor, Friend of sinners,  
Earth's Redeemer plead for me,  
Where the songs of all the sinless  
Sweep across the crystal sea.
