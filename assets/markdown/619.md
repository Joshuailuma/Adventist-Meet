# 619 - Lead On, O King Eternal
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
Lead on, O King eternal,  
The day of march has come;  
Henceforth in fields of conquest  
Thy tents shall be our home.  
Through days of preparation  
Thy grace has made us strong;  
And now, O King eternal,  
We lift our battle song.

**2**  
Lead on, O King eternal,  
Till sin’s fierce war shall cease,  
And holiness shall whisper  
The sweet amen of peace.  
For not with swords loud clashing,  
Nor roll of stirring drums;  
With deeds of love and mercy  
The heavenly kingdom comes.   

**3**   
Lead on, O King eternal,  
We follow, not with fears,  
For gladness breaks like morning  
Where’er thy face appears.  
Thy cross is lifted o’er us,  
We journey in its light;  
The crown awaits the conquest;  
Lead on, O God of might.
