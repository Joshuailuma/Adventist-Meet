# 271 - Break Thou the Bread of Life
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Break Thou the bread of life,  
Dear Lord, to me,  
As Thou didst break the loaves  
Beside the sea;  
Beyond the sacred page  
I seek Thee, Lord;  
My spirit pants for Thee,  
O living Word.  
   
**2**  
Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,  
To me, to me,  
As Thou didst bless the bread  
By Galilee;  
Then shall all bondage cease,  
All fetters fall;  
And I shall find my peace,  
My all in all.   

**3**  
Thou art the bread of life,  
O Lord, to me;  
Thy holy Word the truth  
That saveth me;  
Give me to eat and live  
With Thee above;  
Teach me to love Thy truth,  
For Thou art love. 

**4**  
Spirit and life are they,  
Words Thou dost speak;  
I hasten to obey,  
But I am weak;  
Thou art my only help,  
Thou art my life;  
Heeding Thy holy Word  
I win the strife.
