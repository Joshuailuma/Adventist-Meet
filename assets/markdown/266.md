# 266 - Spirit of God
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Spirit of God! descend upon my heart;  
Wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;  
Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art,  
And make me love Thee as I ought to love.
   
**2**  
I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies;  
No sudden rending of the veil of clay;  
No angel visitant, no op'ning skies;  
But take the dimness of my soul away.

**3**  
Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?  
All, all Thine own, soul, heart, and strength, and mind;  
I see Thy cross, there teach my heart to cling:  
O let me seek Thee, and O let me find! 

**4**  
Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;  
Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear;  
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;  
Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.  

**5**  
Teach me to love Thee as Thine angels love,  
One holy passion filling all my frame;  
The baptism of the heav'n-descended dove,  
My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.
