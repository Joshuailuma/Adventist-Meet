# 625 - Higher Ground
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**    
I'm pressing on the upward way,  
New heights I'm gaining every day;  
Still praying as I onward bound,  
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."  


### Refrain  
Lord, lift me up, and I shall stand  
By faith, on heaven's tableland;  
A higher plane than I have found;  
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. 

**2**  
My heart has no desire to stay  
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;  
Though some may dwell where these abound,  
My prayer, my aim is higher ground.      

**3**   
I want to live above the world,  
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;  
For faith has caught the joyful sound,  
The song of saints on higher ground. 

**4**  
I want to scale the utmost height,  
And catch a gleam of glory bright;  
But still I'll pray till heaven I've found,  
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground."
