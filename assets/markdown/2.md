O clouds that ride the winds aloft:  
Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!  
O rising morn, in praise rejoice,  
O lights of evening, find a voice.

Make music for your Lord to hear.

Providing us with warmth and light,

Let all things their Creator bless,  
And worship Him in humbleness,

And praise the Spirit, three in One!
