# 180 - O Listen to Our Wondrous Story
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**  
O listen to our wondrous story,  
Counted once among the lost;  
Yet One came down from heaven's glory,  
Saving us at awful cost.  


### Refrain  
Who saved us from eternal loss?  
What did He do? Where is He now?  
In heaven interceding! 

**2**  
No angel could His place have taken,  
Highest of the high tho' he;  
The loved One on the cross forsaken  
Was One of the Godhead three!
   
**3**  
Will you surrender to this Savior?  
To His scepter humbly bow;  
You, too, shall come to know His favor,  
He will save you, save you now.
