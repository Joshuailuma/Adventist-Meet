# 306 - Draw Me Nearer
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,  
And it told Thy love to me;  
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,  
And be closer drawn to Thee.  


### Refrain  
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,  
To the cross where Thou hast died;  
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,  
To Thy precious, bleeding side. 
   
**2**  
Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,  
By the power of grace divine;  
May my soul look up with a steadfast hope  
And my will be lost in Thine.   

**3**  
O the pure delight of a single hour  
That before Thy throne I spend,  
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,  
I commune as friend with friend!
