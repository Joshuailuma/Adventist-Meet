# 223 - Crown Him With Many Crowns
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Crown Him with many crowns,  
The Lamb upon His throne;  
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns  
All music but its own!  
Awake, my soul, and sing  
Of Him who died for thee;  
And hail Him as thy matchless King  
Through all eternity.
   

**2**  
Crown Him with many crowns,  
The Lamb upon His throne;  
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns  
All music but its own!  
Awake, my soul, and sing  
Of Him who died for thee;  
And hail Him as thy matchless King  
Through all eternity.
  

**3**  
Crown Him the Lord of peace!  
Whose hand a scepter sways  
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,  
And all be prayer and praise;  
His reign shall know no end,  
And round His pierced feet  
Fair flowers of Paradise extend,  
Their fragrance ever sweet. 

**4**  
Crown Him the Lord of years,  
The Potentate of time,  
Creator of the rolling spheres,  
Ineffably sublime!  
All hail! Redeemer, hail!  
For Thou hast died for me;  
Thy praise shall never, never fail  
Throughout eternity.
