# 157 - Go to Dark Gethsemane
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Go to dark Gethsemane,  
Ye that feel the tempter's power;  
Your Redeemer's conflict see;  
Watch with Him one bitter hour;  
Turn not from His griefs away;  
Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.    

**2**  
See Him at the judgment hall,  
Beaten, bound, reviled, arraigned;  
See Him meekly bearing all;  
Love to man His soul sustained;  
Shun not suffering, shame, or loss;  
Learn of Christ to bear the cross.    

**3**  
Calvary's mournful mountain climb;  
There adoring at His feet,  
Mark that miracle of time,  
God's own sacrifice complete;  
"It is finished!" hear Him cry;  
Learn of Jesus Christ to die. 
Learn of Jesus Christ to die.
