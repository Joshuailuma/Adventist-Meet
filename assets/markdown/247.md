# 247 - Come My Way
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:  
Such a Way, as gives us breath;  
Such a Truth, as ends all strife;  
Such a Life, as killeth death.    
   
**2**  
Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:  
Such a Light, as shows a feast;  
Such a Feast, as mends in length;  
Such a Strength, as makes His guest.

**3**  
Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart:  
Such a Joy, as none can move;  
Such a Love, as none can part;  
Such a Heart, as joys in love.
