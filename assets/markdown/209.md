# 209 - That Glorious Day Is Coming
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**  
That glorious day is coming,  
The hour is hastening on;  
Its radiant light is nearing,  
Far brighter than the sun;  
In yonder clouds of heaven,  
The Savior will appear,  
And gather all His chosen,  
To meet Him in the air. 

**2**  
The saints, then all victorious  
Will go to meet their Lord;  
An earth both bright and glorious,  
Will then be their reward;  
And God Himself there reigning,  
Will wipe all tears away;  
Nor clouds nor night remaining,  
But one eternal day. 

**3**  
O Christian, keep from sleeping,  
And let your love abound;  
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,  
The trumpet soon will sound!  
O sinner, hear the warning!  
To Jesus quickly!  
Then you, in that blest morning,  
May meet Him in the sky!
