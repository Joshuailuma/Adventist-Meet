## Key G Major
                                                          
**1**  
O come, O come, Immanuel,  
And ransom captive Israel,  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appear.


### Refrain  
Wake the song, wake the song,  
The song of joy and gladness,  
Wake the song, wake the song,  
The song of Jubilee.
                                                          
**2**  
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,  
And order all things far and night;  
To us the path of knowledge show,  
And cause us in her ways to go.

**3**  
O come, Desire of nations, bind  
All peoples in one heart and mind;  
Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease;  
Fill the whole world with heaven’s peace.
