**1**  
God moves in a mysterious way  
His wonders to perform;  
He plants His footsteps in the sea,  
And rides upon the storm.
                                                          
**2**  
Give to the Lord of lords renown,  
The King of kings with glory crown:  
His mercies ever shall endure  
When lords and kings are known no more.

**3**  
He sent His Son with power to save  
From guilt and darkness and the grave:  
Wonders of grace to God belong,  
Repeat His mercies in your song.

**4**  
Thro’ this vain world He guides our feet,  
And leads us to His heav’nly seat:  
His mercies ever shall endure,  
When this vain world shall be no more.
