# 461 - Be Still, My Soul
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Be still, my soul:  
Rhe Lord is on thy side;  
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;  
Leave to thy God to order and provide;  
In every change He faithful will remain.  
Be still, my soul:   
Thy best, thy heavenly friend  
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

**2**  
Be still, my soul:  
Thy God doth undertake  
To guide the future as He has the past.  
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;  
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.  
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know  
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below.

**3**  
Be still, my soul:  
The hour is hastening on  
When we shall be forever with the Lord,  
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,  
Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.  
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past,  
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
