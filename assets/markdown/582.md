# 582 - Working, O Christ, With Thee
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
Working, O Christ, with Thee,  
Working with Thee,  
Unworthy, sinful, weak,  
Though we may be;  
Our all to Thee we give,  
For Thee alone we live,  
And by Thy grace achieve,  
Working with Thee.   

**2**  
Along the city's waste,  
Working with Thee,  
Our eager footsteps haste,  
Like Thee to be;  
The poor we gather in,  
The outcasts raise from sin,  
And labor souls to win,  
Working with Thee.    

**3**  
Savior, we weary not,  
Working with Thee,  
As hard as Thine our lot  
Can never be;  
Our joy and comfort this,  
"Thy grace sufficient is;"  
This changes toil to bliss,  
Working with Thee.

**4**  
So let us labor on,  
Working with Thee,  
Till earth to Thee is won,  
From sin set free;  
Till men, from shore to shore,  
Receive Thee, and adore,  
And join us evermore,  
Working with Thee.
