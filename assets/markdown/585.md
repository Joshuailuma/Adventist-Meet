# 585 - When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**    
When Christ was lifted from the earth  
His arms stretched out above  
Through every culture, every birth,  
To draw an answering love.     

**2**  
Still east and west His love extends  
And always, near or far,  
He calls and claims us as His friends  
And love us as we are.    

**3**   
Where generation, class or race  
Divides us to our shame  
He sees not labels but a face,  
A person and a name. 

**4**  
Thus freely loved, tho' fully known  
May I in Christ be free  
To welcome and accept His own  
As Christ accepted me.
