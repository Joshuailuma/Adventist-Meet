# 285 - Jesus Calls Us
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
Jesus calls us; o'er the tumult  
Of our life's wild, restless sea,  
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,  
Saying, "Christian, follow Me.       
   
**2**  
Jesus calls us from the worship  
Of the vain world's golden store,  
From each idol that would keep us,  
Saying, "Christian, love Me more.   

**3**  
In our joys and in our sorrows,  
Days of toil and hours of ease,  
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,  
"Christian, love Me more than these.

**4**  
Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,  
Savior, may we hear Thy call,  
Give our hearts to Thy obedience,  
Serve and love Thee best of all.
