**1**  
Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!  
All praise to Him belongs;  
Who kindly lengthens out our days,  
Inspires our choicest songs,  
Inspires our choicest songs.
                                                          
**2**  
He providence hath brought us through  
Another various year;  
We all, with vows and anthems new,  
Before our God appear,  
Before our God appear.

**3**  
O God, Thy mercies past we own,  
And Thy continued care;  
To Thee presenting through Thy Son  
Whate’er we have and are,  
Whate’er we have and are.
