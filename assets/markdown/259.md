# 259 - Draw Us in the Spirit's Tether
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Draw us in the Spirit's tether,  
For when humbly in Thy name,  
Two or three are met together,  
Thou art in the midst of them;  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
Touch we now Thy garment's hem.   
   
**2**  
As the brethren used to gather  
In the name of Christ to sup,  
Then with thanks to God the Father  
Break the bread and bless the cup,  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
So knit Thou our friendship up.  

**3**  
All our meals and all our living  
Make us sacraments of Thee,  
That by caring, helping, giving,  
We may true disciples be.  
Alleluia! Alleluia!  
We will serve Thee faithfully.
