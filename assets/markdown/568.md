# 568 - Make Me a Captive, Lord
-------------------
## Key Db Major


**1**    
Make me a captive, Lord,  
And then I shall be free;  
Force me to render up my sword,  
And I shall conqueror be.  
I sink in life's alarms  
When by myself I stand;  
Imprison me within Thine arms,  
And strong shall be my hand. 

**2**  
My heart is weak and poor  
Till it a master find;  
It has no spring of action sure;  
It varies with the wind.  
It cannot freely move  
Till Thou hast wrought its chain;  
Enslave it with Thy matchless love,  
And deathless it shall reign.  

**3**  
My will is not my own  
Till Thou hast made it Thine;  
If it would reach a monarch's throne  
It must its crown resign;  
It only stands unbent,  
Amid the clashing strife,  
When on Thy bosom it has leant  
And found in Thee its life.
