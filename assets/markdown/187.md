## Key F Major


**1**  
Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!  
Jesus! Lover of my soul;  
Friends may fail me, foes assail me,  
He, my Savior, makes me whole.  


### Refrain  
Hallelujah! what a Savior!  
Hallelujah! what a Friend!  
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,  
He is with me to the end. 

**2**  
Jesus! what a Strength for weakness!  
Let me hide myself in Him;  
Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,  
He, my Strength, my vict'ry wins.     

**3**  
Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!  
While the billows o'er me roll,  
Even when my heart is breaking,  
He, my Comfort, helps my soul. 

**4**  
Jesus! I do now receive Him,  
More than all in Him I find,  
He hath granted me forgiveness,  
I am His, and He is mine.
