# 274 - O Word of God Incarnate
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
O Word of God Incarnate,  
O Wisdom from on high,  
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,  
O Light of our dark sky,  
We praise Thee for the radiance  
That from the hallowed page,  
A lantern to our footsteps,  
Shines on from age to age.   
   
**2**  
The church from her dear Master  
Received the gift divine,  
And still that light she lifteth  
O'er all the earth to shine.  
It is the golden casket,  
Where gems of truth are stored  
It is the heaven-drawn picture  
Of Christ, the living Word. 

**3**  
It floateth like a banner  
Before God's host unfurled  
It shineth like a beacon  
Above the darkling world.  
It is the chart and compass  
That o'er life's surging sea,  
'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,  
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.   

**4**  
O make Thy church, dear Savior,  
A lamp of purest gold,  
To bear before the nations  
Thy true light, as of old.  
O teach Thy wandering pilgrims  
By this their path to trace,  
Till, clouds and darkness ended,  
They see Thee face to face.
