# 204 - Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Come, Thou long-expected Jesus!  
Born to set Thy people free,  
From our fears and sins release us,  
Let us find our rest in Thee.  
Israel's strength and consolation,  
Hope of all the earth Thou art;  
Dear Desire of every nation,  
Joy of every longing heart. 

**2**  
Born Thy people to deliver,  
Born a child, and yet a King,  
Born to reign in us forever,  
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring,  
By Thy own eternal Spirit,  
Rule in all our hearts alone;  
By Thy all-sufficient merit,  
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
