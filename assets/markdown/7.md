# 7 - The Lord in Zion Reigneth
----------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
The Lord in Zion reigneth,  
Let all the world rejoice,  
And come before His throne of race  
With tuneful heart and voice;  
The Lord in Zion reigneth,  
And there His praise shall ring,  
To Him shall princes bend the knee  
And kings their glory bring.  

**2**  
The Lord in Zion reigneth,  
And who so great as He?  
The depths of earth are in His hands;  
He rules the mighty sea.  
O crown His name with honour,  
And let His standard wave,  
Till distant isles beyond the deep  
Shall own His power to save.

**3**  
The Lord in Zion reigneth,  
These hours to Him belong;  
O enter now His temple gates,  
And fill His courts with song;  
Beneath His royal banner  
Let every creature fall,  
Exalt the King of heaven and earth,  
And crown Him Lord of all.
