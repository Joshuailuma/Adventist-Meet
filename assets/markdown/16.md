**1**  
All people that on earth do dwell,  
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;  
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,  
Come ye before Him and rejoice.

**2**  
Know that the Lord is God indeed;  
Without our aid He did us make;  
We are His folk, He doth us feed,  
And for His sheep He doth us take.

**3**  
O enter then His gates with praise,  
Approach with joy His courts unto;  
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,  
For it is seemly so to do.

**4**  
For why the Lord or God is good,  
His mercy is forever sure;  
His truth at all times firmly stood,  
And shall from age to age endure.
