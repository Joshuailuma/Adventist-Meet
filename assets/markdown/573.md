# 573 - I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
It may not be on the mountain's height,  
Or over the stormy sea;  
It may not be at the battle's front  
My Lord will have need of me;  
But if by a still, small voice He calls  
To paths I do not know,  
I'll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,  
I'll go where You want me to go.     


### Refrain  
I'll go where You want me to go, dear Lord,  
O'er mountain, or plain, or sea;  
I'll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,  
I'll be what You want me to be.  

**2**  
Perhaps today there are loving words  
Which Jesus would have me speak;  
There may be now, in the paths of sin,  
Some wand'rer whom I should seek.  
O Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide,  
Tho' dark and rugged the way,  
My voice shall echo the message sweet,  
I'll say what You want me to say.   

**3**   
There's surely some where a lowly place  
In earth's harvest-fields so wide,  
Where I may labor thro' life's short day  
For Jesus, the Crucified.  
So, trusting my all unto Thy care,  
I know Thou lovest me!  
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere,  
I'll be what You want me to be.
