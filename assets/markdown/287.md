# 287 - Softly and Tenderly
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,  
Calling for you and for me;  
At the heart's portal He's waiting and watching,  
Watching for you and for me.  


### Refrain  
Come home, come home,  
Ye who are weary, come home;  
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling,  
Calling, O sinner, come home! 
   
**2**  
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,  
Pleading for you and for me?  
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,  
Mercies for you and for me?    

**3**  
Think of the wonderful love He has promised,  
Promised for you and for me;  
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,  
Pardon for you and for me.
