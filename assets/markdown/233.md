# 233 - Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Christ, whose glory fills the skies,  
Christ, the true, the only light,  
Sun of Righteousness, a rise,  
Triumph o'er the shades of night;  
Day-spring from on high, be near;  
Day-star, in my heart appear.  
   
**2**  
Dark and cheerless is the morn  
Unaccompanied by Thee;  
Joyless is the day's return  
Till Thy mercy's beams I see;   
Till they inward light impart,  
Cheer my eyes and warm my heart.

**3**  
Visit, then, this soul of mine;  
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;  
Fill me, Radiancy divine;  
Scatter all my unbelief;  
More and more Thyself display,  
Shining to the perfect day.
