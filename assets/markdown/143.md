# 143 - Silent Night, Holy Night
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Silent night, holy night,  
All is calm, all is bright;  
Round yon virgin mother and Child!  
Holy Infant, so tender and mild,  
Sleep in heavenly peace,  
Sleep in heavenly peace.

**2**  
Silent night, holy night,  
Darkness flies, all is light;  
Shepherds hear the angels sing,  
Alleluia! Hail the King!  
Christ the Saviour is born,  
Christ the Saviour is born

**3**  
Silent night, holy night,  
Son of God, love’s pure light;  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,  
With the dawn of redeeming grace,  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

**4**  
Silent night, holy night,  
Wondrous star, lend thy light;  
With the angels let us sing,  
Alleluia to our King;  
Christ the Saviour is born,  
Christ the Saviour is born.
