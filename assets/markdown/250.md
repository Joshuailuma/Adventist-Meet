# 250 - O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
O for a thousand tongues to sing  
My great Redeemer's praise,  
The glories of my God and King,  
The triumphs of His grace!    
   
**2**  
My gracious Master and my God,  
Assist me to proclaim  
To spread thro' all the earth abroad  
The honors of Thy name.

**3**  
Jesus! the name that charms our fears,  
That bids our sorrows cease,  
'Tis music in the sinners' ears,  
Tis life, and health, and peace. 

**4**  
He breaks the power of canceled sin,  
He sets the prisoner free;  
His blood can make the foulest clean;  
His blood availed for me. 

**5**  
He speaks, and listening to His voice,  
New life the dead receive;  
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice;  
The humble poor, believe. 

**6**  
Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,  
Your loosened tongues employ;  
Ye blind, behold your Savior come;  
And leap, ye lame, for joy.
