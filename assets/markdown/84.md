**1**  
God the omnipotent! King, who ordainest  
Great winds Thy clarions, the lightenings Thy sword;  
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou Reignest,  
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

**2**  
God the all-merciful! Earth hath forsaken  
Thy precepts holy, and slighted Thy word;  
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;  
Give to us peace, O most merciful Lord.

**3**  
God the all-righteous One! Man hath defied Thee;  
Yet to eternity standeth Thy word;  
Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;  
Prosper the right, O most merciful Lord.  

**4**  
So shall we render Thee thankful devotion,  
For thy deliverance from peril and sword,  
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,  
“Thine is the power and the glory, O Lord.”
