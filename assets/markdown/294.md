# 294 - Power in the Blood
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Would you be free from the burden of sin?  
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;  
Would you o'er evil a victory win?  
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.   


### Refrain  
There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r  
In the blood of the Lamb;  
There is pow'r, pow'r, wonder-working pow'r  
In the precious blood of the Lamb.
   
**2**  
Would you be free from your passion and pride?  
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;  
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide?  
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.   

**3**  
Would you do service for Jesus your King?  
There's pow'r in the blood, pow'r in the blood;  
Would you live daily His praises to sing?  
There's wonderful pow'r in the blood.
