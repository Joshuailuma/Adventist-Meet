-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**  
Lord, I have made Thy word my choice,  
My lasting heritage;  
There shall my noblest pow'rs rejoice,  
My warmest thoughts engage.   
   
**2**  
I'll read the histories of Thy love,  
And keep Thy laws in sight;  
While through Thy promises I rove,  
With ever fresh delight.  

**3**  
In this broad land of wealth unknown,  
Where springs of life arise,  
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,  
And hidden glory lies.  

**4**  
The best relief that mourners have,  
It makes our sorrows blest;  
Our fairest hope beyond the grave,  
And our eternal rest.
