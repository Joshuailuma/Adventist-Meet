# 530 - It Is Well With My Soul
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,  
When sorrows like sea billows roll  
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,  
It it well, it is well with my soul.  


### Refrain  
It is well with my soul,  
It is well, it is well with my soul.   

**2**  
My sin O the joy of this glorious thought  
My sin, not in part, but the whole,  
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more:  
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! 

**3**  
And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,  
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll:  
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,  
"Even so" it is well with my soul.
