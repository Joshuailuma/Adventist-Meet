# 239 - Jesus, Priceless Treasure
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Jesus, priceless treasure,  
Source of purest pleasure,  
Truest Friend to me:  
Ah! how long I've panted,  
And my heart has fainted,  
Thirsting, Lord, for Thee.  
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,  
I will suffer naught to hide Thee,  
Nought I ask beside Thee. 
   
**2**  
In Thine arm I rest me;  
Foes who would molest me  
Cannot reach me here;  
Though the earth be shaking,  
Every heart be quaking,  
Jesus calms my fear;  
Sin and hell in conflict fell  
With their bitter storms assail me:  
Jesus will not fail me.

**3**  
Hence all fears and sadness!  
For the Lord of gladness,  
Jesus enters in;  
Those who love the Father,  
Tho' the storms may gather,  
Still have peace within;  
Yea, whate'er I here must bear,  
Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,  
Jesus, priceless treasure!
