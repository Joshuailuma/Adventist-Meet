-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;  
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;  
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;  
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.    
   
**2**  
I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,  
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;  
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;  
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now. 

**3**  
I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee 'til death,  
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;  
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow,  
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now. 

**4**  
In mansions of glory and endless delight,  
I'l! ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;  
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,  
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.
