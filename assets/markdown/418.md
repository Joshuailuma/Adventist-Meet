# 418 - Day of Judgment, Day of Wonders!
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
Day of judgment, day of wonders!  
Hark the trumpet's awful sound,  
Louder than a thousand thunders,  
Shakes the vast creation round!  
How the summons,  
How the summons  
Will the sinner's heart confound!        

**2**   
See the Lord in glory nearing,  
Clothed in majesty divine.  
You who long for His appearing,  
Then shall say, ''This God is mine!"  
Gracious Savior,  
Gracious Savior,  
Own me in that day as Thine.    

**3**  
At His call the dead awaken,  
Rise to life from earth and sea!  
All the powers of nature shaken  
By His looks prepare to flee.  
Careless sinner,  
Careless sinner,  
What will then become of thee? 

**4**  
But to those who have confessed  
Loved and served the lard below,  
He will say, "Come near, ye blessed,  
See the kingdom I bestow;  
You forever,  
You forever  
Shall My love and glory know?
