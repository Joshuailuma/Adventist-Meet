# 584 - There's A Spirit in the Air
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
There's a Spirit in the air,    
Telling Christians everywhere  
"Praise the love that Christ revealed,  
Living, working in our world."    

**2**  
Lose your shyness, find your tongue;  
Tell the world what God has done:  
God in Christ has come to stay,  
We can see His pow'r today.     

**3**   
When believers break the bread  
When a hungry child is fed:  
Praise the love that Christ revealed  
Living, working in our world. 

**4**  
Still His Spirit leads the fight,    
Seeing wrong and setting right:   
God in Christ has come to stay,  
We can see His pow'r today. 

**5**  
When a stranger's not a alone,  
Where the homeless find a home,  
Praise the love that Christ revealed,  
Living, working in our world.
