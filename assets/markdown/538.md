# 538 - Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**    
Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,  
Pilgrim through this barren land;  
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;  
Hold me with Thy powerful hand;  
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,  
Feed me till I want no more,  
Feed me till I want no more.   

**2**  
Open now the crystal fountain,   
Whence the healing stream doth flow;  
Let the fire and cloudy pillar  
Lead me all my journey through;  
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer.  
Be Thou still my strength and shield,  
Be Thou still my strength and shield. 

**3**  
When I tread the verge of Jordan,  
Bid my anxious fears subside;  
Death of death and hell's destruction,  
Land me safe on Canaan's side;  
Songs of praises, songs of praises  
I will ever give to Thee,  
I will ever give to Thee.
