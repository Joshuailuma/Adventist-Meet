# 227 - Jesus Shall Reign
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Jesus shall reign where e'r the sun  
Does its successive journeys run;  
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,  
Till moons shall wax and wane no more  
   

**2**  
People and realms of every tongue  
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;  
And infant voices shall proclaim  
Their earthly blessings on His name. 

**3**  
Blessings abound where e'r He reigns:  
The pris'ners leap to lose their chains,  
The weary find eternal rest,  
And all who suffer want are blest.  

**4**  
Let every creature rise and bring  
Honors peculiar to our King;  
Angels descend with songs again,  
And earth repeat the loud amen
