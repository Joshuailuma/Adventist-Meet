# 603 - Christian, Seek Not Repose
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
Christian, seek not yet repose,  
Cast thy dreams of ease away;  
Thou art in the midst of foes;  
Watch and pray!      

**2**  
Gird thy heavenly armor on,  
Wear it ever, night and day;  
Ambushed lies the evil one;  
Watch and pray!        

**3**   
Hear the victors who o’ercame;  
Still they mark each warrior’s way;  
All with one sweet voice exclaim:  
“Watch and pray!”

**4**  
Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,  
Him thou lovest to obey;  
Hide within thy heart His word;  
“Watch and pray!”

**5**  
Watch, as if on that alone,  
Hung the issue of the day;  
Pray that help may be sent down;  
Watch and pray!
