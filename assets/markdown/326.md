# 326 - Open My Eyes That I May See
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
Open my eyes, that I may see  
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;  
Place in my hands the wonderful key  
That shall unclasp and set me free.    


### Refrain  
Silently now I wait for Thee,  
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;  
Open my eyes, illumine me,  
Spirit divine! 
   
**2**  
Open my ears, that I may hear  
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;  
And while the wave-notes fall on my ear,  
Everything false will disappear.   

**3**  
Open my mouth, and let me bear  
Gladly the warm truth ev'rywhere;  
Open my heart, and let me prepare  
Love with Thy children thus to share.  

**4**  
Haste thee on from grace to glory,  
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;  
Heaven's eternal day's before thee;  
God's own hand shall guide thee there.  
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,  
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;  
Hope shall change to glad fruition,  
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
