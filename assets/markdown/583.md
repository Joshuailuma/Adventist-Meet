# 583 - You That Know the Lord
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
You that know the Lord is gracious,  
You for whom cornerstone  
Stands, of God, elect and precious,  
Laid that you may build thereon,  
See that on that sure foundation  
You a living temple raise.  
Towers that may tell forth salvation  
Walls that may re-echo praise.   

**2**  
Living stones by God appointed  
Each to his alotted place,  
Kings and priests, by God anointed,  
Shall you not declare His grace?  
You a royal generation  
Tell the tidings of your birth,  
Tidings of a new creation  
To an old and weary earth.     

**3**   
Tell the praise of Him who called you  
Out of darkness into light,  
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,  
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:  
Tell the tale of sins forgiven  
Strength renewed and hope restored.  
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,  
Praise and magnify the Lord.
