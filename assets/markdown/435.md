# 435 - The Glory Song
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
When all my labors and trails are o’er,  
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,  
Just to be near the Lord I adore,  
Will through the ages be glory for me.  


### Refrain  
O that will be  
Glory for me, Glory for me,  
Glory for me;  
When by His grace  
I shall look on His face,  
That will be glory, be glory for me. 
   
**2**  
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,  
I am accorded in heaven a place,  
Just to be there and to look on His face,  
Will through the ages be glory for me  

**3**  
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;  
Joy like a river around me will flow,  
Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,  
Will through the ages be glory for me.
