**1**  
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay. 
                                                          
**2**  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus! look down from the sky,  
And stay by my side till the morning is nigh.

**3**  
Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay   
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,  
And fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there.
