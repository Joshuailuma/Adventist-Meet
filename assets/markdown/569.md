# 569 - Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**    
Pass me not, O gentle Savior,  
Hear my humble cry;  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.    


### Refrain  
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry,  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by. 

**2**  
Let me at Thy throne of mercy  
Find a sweet relief;  
Kneeling there in deep contrition,  
Help my unbelief.  

**3**   
Trusting only in Thy merit,  
Would I seek Thy face;  
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,  
Save me by Thy grace. 

**4**   
Thou the spring of all my comfort,  
More than life for me;  
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?  
Whom in heaven but Thee?
