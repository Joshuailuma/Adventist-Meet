**1**  
Rejoice ye pure in heart!  
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;  
Your festal banner wave on high,  
The cross of Christ your King.


### Refrain  
Oh, praise Him! Oh, praise Him!  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!  

**2**  
With voice as full and strong  
As ocean’s surging praise,  
Send forth the sturdy hymns of old,  
The psalms of ancient days.

**3**  
With all the angel choirs,  
With all the saints of earth,  
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,  
True rapture, noblest mirth.

**4**  
Yes, on through life’s long path,  
Still chanting as ye go;  
From youth to age, by night and day,  
In gladness and in woe.

**5**  
Praise Him who reigns on high,  
The Lord whom we adore,  
The Father, Son and Holy Ghost,  
One God forever more.
