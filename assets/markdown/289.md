# 289 - The Savior Is Waiting
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
The Savior is waiting to enter your heart,  
Why don't you let Him come in?  
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart,  
What is your answer to Him?   


### Refrain  
Time after time He has waited before,  
And now He is waiting again  
To see if you're willing to open the door:  
O how He wants to come in. 
   
**2**  
If you'll take one step toward the Savior, my friend,  
You'll find His arms open wide;  
Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end,  
Within your heart He'll abide.
