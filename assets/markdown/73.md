**1**  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!  
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;  
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!  
God in three persons, blessed Trinity.

**2**  
Holy, holy, holy! Angels adore Thee,  
Casting down their bright crowns around the glassy sea;  
Thousands and ten thousands worship low before Thee,  
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

**3**  
Holy, holy, holy! Though darkness hide Thee,  
Thought they eye of man Thy great glory may not see;  
Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,  
Perfect in power, in love and purity.

**4**  
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!  
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;  
Holy, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!  
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
