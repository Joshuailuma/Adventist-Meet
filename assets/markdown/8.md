**1**  
We gather together to ask the Lord's blessing;  
He chastens and hastens His will to make known;  
The wicked oppressing now cease from distressing,  
Sing praises to his name; He forgets not His own.

**2**  
Besides us to guide us, our God with us joining,  
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;  
So from the begining the fight we were winning;  
Thou, Lord wast at our side; all glory be thine.

**3**  
We all do extol Thee, Thou Leader triuphant,  
And pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be.  
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;  
Thy name be ever praised! O Lord make us free!
