Be not dismayed whate’er betide,  
God will take care of you;  
Beneath his wings of love abide,  
God will take care of you.


### Refrain  
God will take care of you,  
Through every day, o’er all the way;  
He will take care of you,  
God will take care of you.

Through days of toil when your heart doth fail,  
God will take care of you;  
When dangers fierce your path assail,  
God will take care of you.

**3**  
All you may need he will provide,  
God will take care of you;  
Nothing you ask will be denied,  
God will take care of you.

**4**  
No matter what may be the test,  
God will take care of you;  
Lean, weary one, upon his breast,  
God will take care of you.
