# 655 - Happy the Home  
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**     
Happy the home when God is there,  
And love fills every breast;  
When one their wish, and one their prayer,   
And one their heavenly rest. 

**2**  
Happy the home where Jesus' name  
Is sweet to every ear;  
Where children early lisp His fame,  
And parents hold Him dear.    

**3**   
Happy the home where prayer is heard,   
And praise is wont to rise;  
Where parents love the Sacred Word  
And all its wisdom prize. 

**4**  
Lord, let us in our homes agree  
This blessed peace to gain;  
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,  
And love to all will reign.
