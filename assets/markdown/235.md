# 235 - Christ Is Made the Sure Foundation
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Christ is made the sure foundation,  
Christ, our head and cornerstone,  
Chosen of the Lord and precious,  
Binding all the Church in one;  
Holy Zion's help forever  
And our confidence alone.
   
**2**  
To this temple where we call You,  
Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay;  
Come, with all Your loving kindness,  
Hear Your people as they pray;  
And Your fullest benediction  
Shed within these walls today.

**3**  
Grant, we pray to all Your faithful  
All the gifts they ask to gain;  
What they gain from You forever  
With the blessed to retain;  
And hereafter in Your glory  
Evermore with You to reign.    

**4**  
Praise and honor to the Father,  
Praise and honor to the Son,  
Praise and honor to the Spirit,  
Ever three and ever one:  
One in might and one in glory  
While unending ages run!
