# 283 - O Jesus, Thou Art Standing
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
O Jesus, Thou art standing  
Outside the fast-closed door,  
In lowly patience waiting  
To pass the threshold o'er:  
O shame, professing Christian,  
His name and sign who bear,  
O shame, thrice shame upon us,  
To keep Him standing there!       
   
**2**  
O Jesus, Thou art knocking;  
And, lo, that hand is scarred,  
And thorns Thy brow encircle,  
And tears Thy face have marred.  
O love that passeth knowledge,  
So patiently to wait!  
O sin that hath no equal,  
So fast to bar the gate!   

**3**  
O Jesus, Thou art pleading  
In accents meek and low,  
"I died for you, My children,  
And will ye treat Me so?"  
O Lord, with shame and sorrow  
We open now the door;  
Dear Savior, enter, enter,  
And leave us nevermore.
