Come, Thou almighty King,
Help us to praise!  
Father all glorious, O’er all victorious,  
Come, and reign over us,  
Ancient of Days!

**2**  
Come, Thou incarnate Word,  
Gird on Thy mighty sword,  
Our prayer attend;  
Come, and Thy people bless,  
And give Thy Word success;  
Spirit of holiness, on us descend!

**3**  
Come, Thou incarnate Word,  
Gird on Thy mighty sword,

Come, and Thy people bless,  
And give Thy Word success;  
Spirit of holiness, on us descend!

**4**  
To Thee, great One in Three,  
Eternal praises be,  
Hence, evermore:  
Thy sovereign majesty  
May we in glory see, And to eternity  
Love and adore!
