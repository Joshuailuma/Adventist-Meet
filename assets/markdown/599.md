## Key D Major


**1**    
Rejoice, rejoice, believers,  
And let your lights appear:  
The evening is advancing,  
And darker night is near.  
The Bridegroom is arising  
And soon He draweth nigh:  
Up, pray and watch and wrestle,  
At midnight comes the cry.       

**2**  
The watchers on the mountain  
Proclaim the Bridegroom near.  
Go, meet Him as He cometh,  
With hallelujahs clear.  
The marriage feast is waiting,  
The gates wide open stand;  
Up, up, you heirs of glory,  
The Bridegroom is at hand.          

**3**   
You saints who here in patience  
Your cross and suff'rings bore,  
Shall live and reign forever,  
When sorrow is no more.  
Upon the throne of glory  
The Lamb you shall behold,  
In triumph cast before Him  
Your diadems of gold. 

**4**  
Our hope and expectation,  
O Jesus, now appear;  
Arise, O sun so longed for,  
O'er this benighted sphere!  
With hearts and hands uplifted,  
We plead, O Lord, to see  
The day of earth's redemption  
That brings us unto Thee.
