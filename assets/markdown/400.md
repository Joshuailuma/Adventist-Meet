# 400 - I Come With Joy
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
In imitation, Lord, of Thee,
This solemn service we repeat;
For Thine example, full of grace,
Has made this humble duty sweet.    

**2**   
I come with Christians far and near  
To find, as all are fed,  
Our true community of love  
In Christ's communion bread,  
In Christ's communion bread. 

**3**  
As Christ breaks bread for us to share  
Each proud division ends.  
That love that made us makes us one,  
And strangers now are friends,  
And strangers now are friends.

**4**  
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.  
His presence always near,  
Is in such friendship better known:  
We see and praise Him here,  
We see and praise Him here. 

**5**  
Together met, together bound,  
We'll go our diff'rent ways,  
And as His people in the world,  
We'll live and speak His praise,  
We'll live and speak His praise.
