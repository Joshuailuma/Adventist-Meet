# 254 - The Great Physician Now Is Near
-------------------
## Key Db Major


**1**  
The Great Physician now is near,  
The sympathizing Jesus;  
He speaks, the drooping heart to cheer,  
O hear the voice of Jesus!      


### Refrain  
Sweetest note in seraph song,  
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,  
Sweetest carol ever sung;  
Jesus, blessed Jesus!  

**2**  
All glory to the dying Lamb!  
I now believe in Jesus;  
I love the blessed Savior's name,  
I love the name of Jesus. 
   
**3**  
His name dispels my guilt and fear;  
No other name but Jesus;  
O how my soul delights to hear  
The precious name of Jesus! 

**4**  
And when He comes to bring the crown  
The crown of life and glory  
Then by His side we will sit down,  
And tell redemption's story
