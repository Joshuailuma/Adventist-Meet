# 355 - Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
Where cross the crowded ways of life,  
Where sound the cries of race and clan,  
Above the noise of selfish strife,  
We hear your voice, O Son of Man.
    
**2**  
From tender childhood’s helplessness,  
From woman’s grief, man’s burdened toil,  
From famished souls, from sorrow’s stress,  
Your heart has never known recoil.

**3**  
The cup of water given for you still  
Holds the freshness of your grace;  
Yet long these multitudes to view  
The sweet compassion of your face.

**4**  
O Master, from the mountainside  
Make haste to heal these hearts of pain;  
Among these restless throngs abide;  
O tread the city’s streets again.

**5**  
Till all the world shall learn your love  
And follow where your feet have trod,  
Till, glorious from your heaven above,  
Shall come the city of our God.
