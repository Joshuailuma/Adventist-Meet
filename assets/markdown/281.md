# 281 - I Gave My Life for Thee
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
I gave My life for thee,  
My precious blood I shed,  
That thou might'st ransomed be,  
And quickened from the dead;  
I gave, I gave My life for thee,  
What hast thou given for Me?  
I gave, I gave My life for thee,  
What hast thou given for Me?      
   
**2**  
My Father's house of light,  
My glory circled throne,  
I left for earthly night,  
For wanderings sad and lone;  
I left, I left it all for thee,  
Hast thou left aught for Me?  
I left, I left it all for thee,  
Hast thou left aught for Me?  

**3**  
I suffered much for thee,  
More than thy tongue can tell,  
Of bitterest agony,  
To rescue thee from hell;  
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,  
What hast thou borne for Me?  
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee,  
What hast thou borne for Me?
