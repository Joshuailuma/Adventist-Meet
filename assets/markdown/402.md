# 402 - By Christ Redeemed
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,  
We keep the memory adored,  
And show the death of our dear Lord,  
Until He come.     

**2**   
His broken body in our stead Is here,  
In this memorial bread;  
And so our feeble love is fed,  
Until He come.   

**3**  
His fearful drops of agony,  
His lifeblood shed for us we see;  
The wine shall tell the mystery,  
Until He come. 

**4**  
And thus that dark betrayal night,  
With the last advent we unite-  
The shame, the glory, by this rite,  
Until He come.
