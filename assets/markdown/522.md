# 522 - My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,  
But wholly lean on Jesus' name. 


### Refrain  
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
All other ground is sinking sand. 

**2**  
When darkness seems to veil His face,  
I rest on His unchanging grace;  
In every high and stormy gale,  
My anchor holds within the veil. 

**3**   
His oath, His covenant, and blood,  
Support me in the whelming flood;  
When all around my soul gives way,  
He then is all my hope and stay. 

**4**  
When He shall come with trumpet sound,  
O may I then in Him be found;  
Clad in His righteousness alone,  
Faultless to stand before the throne.
