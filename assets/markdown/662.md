# 662 - Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence
-------------------
## Key D Minor


**1**     
Let all mortal flesh keep silence,   
And with fear and trembling stand;    
Ponder nothing earthly-minded,   
For with blessing in His hand,   
Christ our God to earth descendeth,  
Our full homage to demand.   
Amen.
