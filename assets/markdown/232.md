# 232 - At the Name of Jesus
-------------------
## Key D Minor


**1**  
At the name of Jesus  
Every knee shall bow,  
Every tongue confess Him  
King of glory now;  
'Tis the Father's pleasure  
We should call Him Lord,  
Who from the beginning  
Was the mighty Word.  
   
**2**  
At His voice creation  
Sprang at once to sight,  
All the angel faces,  
All the hosts of light,  
Thrones and dominations  
Stars upon their way,  
All the heavenly orders  
In their great array. 

**3**  
Humbled for a season,  
To receive a name  
From the lips of sinners,  
Unto whom He came;  
He is God the Savior,  
He is Christ the Lord,  
Ever to be worshiped,  
Trusted and adored

**4**  
In your hearts enthrone Him:  
There let Him subdue  
All that is not holy,  
All that is not true;  
Crown Him as your captain  
In temptation's hour,  
Let His will enfold you  
In its light and power.  

**5**  
Surely, this Lord Jesus  
Shall return again,  
With His Father’s glory,  
With His angel train;  
For all wreaths of empire  
Meet upon His brow,  
And our hearts confess Him  
King of glory now.
