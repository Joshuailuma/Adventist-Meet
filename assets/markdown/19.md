----------------
## Key G Major
                                                          
                                                          
**1**  
O Sing a new song to the Lord  
For Marvels He has done;  
His right hand and His holy arm  
The victory have won.

**2**  
With harp, with harp and voice of psalms  
Unto Jehovah sing;  
Let trumpets and the echoing horn  
Acclaim the Lord our King!

**3**  
Let seas with all their creatures roar,  
The world and dwellers there,  
And let the rivers clap their hands,  
The hills their joy declare.  

**4**
Before the Lord: because He comes,  
To judge the earth comes He;  
He'll judge the world with righteousness,  
His folk with equity.
