# 325 - Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken
-------------------
## Key A Major


**1**  
Jesus, I my cross have taken,  
All to leave and follow Thee;  
All things else I have forsaken;  
Thou from hence my all shalt be.  
Perish every fond ambition,  
All I've sought, or hoped, or known;  
Yet how rich is my condition,  
While I prove the Lord my own.      
   
**2**  
Let the world despise and leave me;  
They have left my Savior, too;  
Human hearts and looks deceive me;  
Thou art faithful, Thou art true.  
O, 'tis not in grief to harm me,  
While Thy love is left to me;  
O, 'twere not in joy to charm me,  
If that love be hid from me.  

**3**  
Soul, then know thy full salvation;  
Rise o'er sin, and fear, and care;  
Joy to find in every station  
Something still to do or bear.  
Think what Spirit dwells within thee;  
Think what Father's smiles are thine;  
Think that Jesus died to win thee;  
Child of Heaven, canst thou repine? 

**4**  
Haste thee on from grace to glory,  
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;  
Heaven's eternal day's before thee;  
God's own hand shall guide thee there.  
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,  
Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;  
Hope shall change to glad fruition,  
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
