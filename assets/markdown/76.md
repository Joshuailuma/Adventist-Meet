**1**  
O Love that wilt not let me go,  
I rest my weary soul in thee;  
I give thee back the life I owe,  
That in thine ocean depths its flow   
May richer, fuller be.

**2**  
O Light that followest all my way,  
I yield my flickering torch to thee;  
My heart restores its borrowed ray,  
That in they sunshine’s blaze  
Its day may brighter, fairer be.

**3**  
O Joy that seekest me through pain,  
I cannot close my heart to thee;  
I trace the rainbow through the rain,  
And feel the promise is not vain,  
That morn shall tearless be.

**4**  
O Cross that liftest up my head,  
I dare not ask to fly from thee;  
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,  
And from the ground there blossoms red  
Life that shall endless be.
