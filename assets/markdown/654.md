# 654 - Lord Bless Our Homes
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**     
Lord, bless our homes with peace and love and laughter,  
With understanding and with loyalty.  
May we together follow Christ the Master  
And know the blessing of His sov'reignty.  

**2**  
May every heart receive His loving spirit  
And know the truth that makes life truly free;  
Then, in that spirit may we live untied,  
And find in God our deep security.   

**3**   
Forgive the hurts our selfishness inflicted  
On those we love and those who love us best.  
Christ, heal the scars, and draw us all together  
In Him whose will is peace and joy and rest.  

**4**  
Father, in gratitude for homes and loved ones,  
We open now our hearts to all mankind.  
Grant us Your spirit-love for one another-  
So in Your peace may we our concord find.
