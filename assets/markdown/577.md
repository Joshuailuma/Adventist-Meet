# 577 - In the Heart of Jesus
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
In the heart of Jesus  
There is love for you,  
Love most pure and tender,  
Love most deep and true;  
Why should you be lonely,  
Why for friendship sigh,  
When the heart of Jesus  
Has a full supply?  

**2**  
In the mind of Jesus  
There is thought for you,  
Warm as summer sunshine,  
Sweet as morning dew;  
Why should you be fearful,  
Why take anxious thought,  
Since the mind of Jesus  
Cares for those He bought?  

**3**  
In the field of Jesus  
There is work for you;  
Such as even angels  
Might rejoice to do;  
Why stand idly sighing  
For some lifework grand,  
While the field of Jesus  
Seeks your reaping hand? 

**4**  
In the home of Jesus  
There's a place for you;  
Glorious, bright, and joyous,  
Calm and peaceful, too;  
Why then, like a wanderer,  
Roam with weary pace,  
If the home of Jesus  
Holds for you a place?
