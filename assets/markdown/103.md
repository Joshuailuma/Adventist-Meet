**1**  
O God, our help in ages past,  
Our hope for years to come,  
Our shelter from the stormy blast,  
And our eternal home!
                                                          
**2**  
Under the shadow of thy throne,  
Still may we dwell secure;  
Sufficient is thine arm alone,  
And our defense is sure.

**3**  
Before the hills in order stood,  
Or earth received her frame,  
From everlasting, thou art God,  
To endless years the same.

**4**  
A thousand ages, in thy sight,  
Are like an evening gone;  
Short as the watch that ends the night,  
Before the rising sun.

**5**  
O God, our help in ages past,  
Our hope for years to come;  
Be thou our guide while life shall last,  
And our eternal home!
