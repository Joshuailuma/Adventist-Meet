# 513 - In Heavenly Love Abiding
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
In Heavenly love abiding,  
No change my heart shall fear,  
And safe is such confiding,  
For nothing changes here.  
The storm may roar without me,  
My heart may low be laid;  
But God is round about me,  
And can I be dismayed?  

**2**  
Wherever He may guide me,   
No want shall turn me back;  
My Shepherd is beside me,  
And nothing can I lack.  
His wisdom ever waketh,  
His sight is never dim;  
He knows the way He taketh,  
And I will; walk with Him.  

**3**   
Green pastures are before me,  
Which yet I have not seen;  
Bright skies will soon be o'er me,  
Where the darkest clouds have been.  
My hope I cannot measure,  
The path to life is free;  
My Saviour has my treasure,  
And He will walk with me.
