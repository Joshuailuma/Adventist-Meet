# 365 - O Zion, Haste
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,  
To tell to all the world that God is light,  
That he who made all nations is not willing  
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night. 


### Refrain  
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;  
Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.  
   
**2**  
Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation  
That God, in whom they live and move, is love;  
Tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,  
And died on earth that we might live above.   

**3**  
Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;  
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;  
Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;  
O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.

**4**  
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,  
Make known to every heart His saving grace;  
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,  
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.
