# 555 - Shepherd of Tender Youth
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
Shepherd of tender youth,  
Guiding in love and truth,  
Through devious ways;  
Christ our triumphant King,  
We come Thy name to sing,  
Hither our children bring  
To shout Thy praise.     

**2**  
Thou art our holy Lord,  
The all-subduing Word,  
Healer of strife;  
Thou didst Thyself abase,  
That from sin's deep disgrace  
Thou mightest save our race,  
And give us life.  

**3**  
Thou art the great High Priest;  
Thou hast prepared the feast  
Of heavenly love;  
While in our mortal pain  
None calls on Thee in vain;  
Help Thou dost not disdain,  
Help from above. 

**4**  
Ever be Thou our Guide,   
Our Shepherd and our pride,  
Our staff and song;  
Jesus, Thou Christ of God,  
By Thy perennial word,  
Lead us where Thou hast trod,  
Make our faith strong.
