**1**  
Hark! the herald angels sing,  
“Glory to the newborn King;  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,  
God and sinners reconciled!”  
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,  
Join the triumph of the skies;  
With th’ angelic host proclaim,  
“Christ is born in Bethlehem!”  
Hark! the herald angels sing,  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  
                                                          
**2**  
Christ, by highest heaven adored,  
Christ the everlasting Lord;  
Late in time behold him come,  
Offspring of a virgin's womb.  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;  
Hail th' incarnate Deity,  
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell,  
Jesus, our Immanuel.  
Hark! the herald angels sing,  
“Glory to the newborn King!”  

**3**  
Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail! the Sun of Righteousness!  
Life and light to all He brings,  
Risen with healing in His wings.  
Mild He lays His glory by,  
Born that man no more may die,  
Born to raise the sons of earth,  
Born to give them second birth.  
Hark! the herald angels sing,  
“Glory to the newborn King!”
