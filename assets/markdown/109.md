**1**  
Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,  
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt!  
Yonder on Calvary’s mount out-poured-  
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.


### Refrain  
Grace, grace (marvelous grace),  
God’s grace (infinite grace),  
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;  
Grace, grace (marvelous grace),  
God’s grace (infinite grace),  
Grace that is greater than all our sin!

**2**  
Sin and despair, like the sea-waves cold,  
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;  
Grace that is greater- yes, grace untold-  
Points to the Refuge, the might Cross.

**3**  
Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,  
Freely bestowed on all who believe!  
You that are longing to see His face,  
Will you this moment His grace receive?
