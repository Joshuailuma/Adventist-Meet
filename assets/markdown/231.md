# 231 - Bless Be the King
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**  
Bless be the King whose coming  
Is in the name of God!  
For Him let doors be opened,  
No hearts against Him barred!  
Not robed in royal splendor,  
In power and pomp comes He;  
But clad as are the poorest,  
Such His humility.  
   
**2**  
Bless be the King whose coming  
Is in the name of God!  
By those who truly listen  
His voice is truly heard;  
Pity the proud and haughty  
Who have not learned to heed  
The Christ who is the promise,  
Who has atonement made.

**3**  
Bless be the King whose coming  
Is in the name of God!  
He only to the humble  
Reveals the face of God  
All power is His, all glory!  
All things are in His hand,   
All ages and all peoples,  
Till time itself shall end. 

**4**  
Bless be the King whose coming  
Is in the name of God!  
He offers to the burdened  
The rest and grace they need.  
Gentle is He and humbled!  
And light His yoke shall be,  
For He would have us bear it  
So He can make us free!
