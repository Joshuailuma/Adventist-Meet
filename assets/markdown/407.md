# 407 - Sent Forth By God's Blessing
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Sent forth by God's blessing,  
Our true faith confessing,  
The people of God from His dwelling take leave.  
The supper is ended.  
Oh, now be extended  
The fruits of this service in all who believe.  
The seed of His teaching,  
Receptive souls reaching,  
Shall blossom in action for God and for all.  
His grace did invite us,  
His love shall unite us  
To work for God's kingdom and answer His call.       

**2**   
With praise and thanksgiving  
To God ever-living,  
The tasks of our everyday life we will face.  
Our faith ever sharing,  
In love ever caring,  
Embracing His children of each tribe and race.  
With Your feast You feed us,  
With Your light now lead us;  
Unite us as one in this life that we share.  
Then may all the living  
With praise and thanksgiving  
Give honor to Christ and His name that we bear.
