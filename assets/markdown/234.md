-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Christ is the world's Light,  
He and none other;  
Born in our darkness, He became our brother.  
If we have seen Him, we have seen the Father:  
Glory to God on high!  
   
**2**  
Christ is the world's Peace,  
He and none other;  
No one can serve Him and despise another.  
Who else unites us one in God the Father?  
Glory to God on high!

**3**  
Christ is the world's Life,  
He and none other;  
Sold once for silver, murdered here, our brother,  
He who redeems us reigns with God the Father.  
Glory to God on high! 

**4**  
Give God the glory,  
God and none other;  
Give God the glory, Spirit, Son, and Father;  
Give God the glory, God in Man my brother;  
Glory to God on high!
