## Key F Major


**1**  
I love thy kingdom, Lord,  
The house of thine abode,  
The church our blest Redeemer saved  
With his own precious blood.  
    
**2**  
I love thy church, O God!  
Her walls before thee stand  
Dear as the apple of thine eye,  
And graven on thy hand.

**3**  
Beyond my highest joy  
I prize her heavenly ways,  
Her sweet communion, solemn vows,  
Her hymns of love and praise.

**4**  
Sure as thy truth shall last,  
To Zion shall be given  
The brightest glories earth can yield,  
And brighter bliss of heaven.
