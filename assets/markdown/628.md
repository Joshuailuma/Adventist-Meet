# 628 - As Jacob With Travel Was Weary
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
A Jacob with travel was weary one day,  
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;  
He saw in a vision a ladder so high  
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.  


### Refrain  
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,  
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,  
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me. 

**2**  
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:  
And remember each step that by faith we pass o'er,  
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before. 

**3**  
And when we arrive at the haven of rest  
We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,  
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”  
O who would not climb such a ladder as this?
