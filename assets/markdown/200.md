# 200 - The Lord Is Coming
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
The Lord is coming, let this be  
The herald note of jubilee;  
And when we meet and when we part  
The salutation from the heart. 


### Refrain  
The Lord is coming, let this be  
The herald note of jubilee,  
The herald note of jubilee. 

**2**  
The Lord is coming! sound it forth  
From east to west, from south to north;  
Speed on! speed on the tidings glad,  
That none who love Him may be sad.      

**3**  
The Lord is coming, swift and sure  
And all His judgments shall endure,  
And none can hope to escape  
His wrath, Who walk not in the narrow path. 

**4**  
This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs  
Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;  
Our praise shall then, in realms of light,  
With all His universe unite.
