**1**  
For God so loved us, He sent the Saviour:  
For God so loved us, and loves me too.

### Refrain  
Love so unending! I’ll sing His praises,  
God loves His children, loves even me.

He sent the Saviour, the blest Redeemer;  
He sent the Saviour to set me free.

**3**  
He bade me welcome, O word of mercy;  
He bade me welcome, O voice divine.

**4**  
He bade me welcome, O word of mercy;  
He bade me welcome, O voice divine.
