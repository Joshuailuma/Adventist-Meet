# 240 - Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Fairest Lord Jesus,  
Ruler of all nature,  
O Thou of God and man the Son!  
Thee will I cherish,  
Thee will I honor,  
Thou art my glory, joy, and crown.  
   
**2**  
Fair are the meadows,  
Fairer still the woodlands,  
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;  
Jesus is fairer,  
Jesus is purer,  
Who makes the woeful heart to sing. 

**3**  
Fair is the sunshine,  
Fairer still the moonlight,  
And all the twinkling, starry host;  
Jesus shines brighter,  
Jesus shines purer  
Than all the angels heaven can boast. 

**4**  
Beautiful Savior,  
Lord of the nations,  
Son of God and Son of Man!  
Glory and honor,  
Praise, adoration,  
Now and forevermore be Thine!
