# 562 - Come Sing A Song of Harvest
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
Come, sing a song of harvest,  
Of thanks for daily food!  
To offer God the first fruits  
Is old as gratitude.    

**2**  
Long, long ago, the reapers,  
Before they kept the feast,  
Put firstfruits in a basket,  
And took it to the priest.  

**3**  
Shall we, sometimes forgetful  
Of where creation starts,  
With science in our pockets  
Lose wonder from our hearts? 

**4**  
May God, the great creator,  
To whom all life belongs,  
Accept this gifts we offer,  
Our service and our songs. 

**5**  
And lest the world go hungry  
While ourselves are fed,  
Make each of us more ready  
To share our daily bread.
