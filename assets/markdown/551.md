# 551 - Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**    
Jesus, Savior, pilot me  
Over life's tempestuous sea;  
Unknown waves before me roll,  
Hiding rock and treacherous shoal,  
Chart and compass come from Thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.     

**2**  
As a mother stills her child,  
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;  
Boisterous waves obey Thy will  
When Thou sayest to them, "Be still.  
Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,  
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.  

**3**  
When at last I near the shore,  
And the fearful breakers roar  
'Twixt me and the peaceful rest,  
Then, while leaning on Thy breast,  
May I hear Thee say to me,  
"Fear not, I will pilot thee.
