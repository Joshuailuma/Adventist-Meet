# 163 - At the Cross
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Alas, and did my Savior bleed?  
And did my Sovereign die?  
Would He devote that sacred head  
For someone such as I? 


### Refrain  
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,  
And the burden of my heart rolled away,  
It was there by faith I received my sight,  
And now I am happy all the day! 

**2**  
Was it for crimes that I have done,  
He suffered on the tree?  
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!  
And love beyond degree!    

**3**  
But drops of grief can ne'er repay  
The debt of love I owe:  
Here, Lord, I give myself away,  
'Tis all that I can do!
