# 620 - On Jordan's Stormy Banks
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,   
And cast a wishful eye  
To Canaan's fair and happy land,  
Where my possessions lie.


### Refrain  
I am bound for the promised land,  
I am bound for the promised land;  
O who will come and go with me?  
I am bound for the promised land. 

**2**  
O'er all those wide extended plains  
Shines one eternal day;  
There, Christ, the Sun, forever reigns,  
And scatters night away.      

**3**   
When shall I reach that happy place,  
And be forever blest?  
When shall I see my Father's face,  
And in His kingdom rest?

**4**  
Filled with delight, my raptured soul  
Would here no longer stay;  
Though Jordan's waves around me roll,  
Fearless I'd launch away.
