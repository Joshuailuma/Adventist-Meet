# 581 - When the Church of Jesus
-------------------
## Key D Minor


**1**    
When the church of Jesus  
Shuts its outer door,  
Lest the roar of traffic  
Drown the voice of prayer:  
May our prayers, Lord, make us  
Ten times more aware  
That the world banish  
Is our Christian care.  

**2**  
If our hearts are lifted  
Where devotion soars  
High above this hungry  
Suffering world of ours;  
Lest our hymns should drug us  
To forget its needs,  
Forge our Christian worship  
Into Christian deeds.    

**3**  
Lest the gifts we offer,  
Money, talents, time,  
Serve to salve our conscience  
To our secret shame;  
Lord, reprove, inspire us  
By the way you give;  
Teach us, dying Savior,  
How true Christians live.
