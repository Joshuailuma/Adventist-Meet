# 145 - Songs of Thankfulness and Praise
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Songs of thankfulness and praise,  
Jesus, Lord, to You we raise,  
Manifested by the star  
To the sages from afar;  
Branch of royal David's stem  
In Your birth at Bethlehem; 


### Refrain  
Anthems be to You addressed,  
God in man made manifest. 

**2**  
Manifest at Jordan's stream,  
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;  
And at Cana, wedding guest,  
In Your Godhead manifest;  
Manifest in power divine,  
Changing water into wine;   

**3**  
Manifest in making whole  
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;  
Manifest in valiant fight,  
Quelling all the devil's might;  
Manifest in gracious will,  
Ever bringing good from ill;  

**4**  
Grant us grace to see You, Lord,  
Mirrored in Your holy Word;  
May we imitate Your way,  
And be pure, as pure we may,  
That we like to You may be  
At Your great epiphany; 


### Refrain  
Let us praise You, ever blest,  
God in man made manifest.
