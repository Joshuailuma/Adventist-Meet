# 680 - Holy Spirit, Hear Us
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**   
Holy Spirit, hear us;  
Help us while we sing;  
Breathe into the music  
Of the praise we bring. 

**2**  
Holy Spirit, prompt us  
When we kneel to pray;  
Nearer come, and teach us  
What we ought to say.

**3**  
Holy Spirit, shine Thou  
On the Book we read;  
Gild its holy pages  
With the light we need.
