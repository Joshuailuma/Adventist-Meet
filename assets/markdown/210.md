# 210 - Wake, Awake, for Night Is Flying
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**  
Wake, awake, for night is flying,  
The watchmen on the heights are crying,  
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!  
Midnight's solemn hour is tolling,  
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,  
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.  
Rise up, with willing feet  
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet;  
Alleluia!  
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,  
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.  

**2**  
Zion hears the watchmen singing,  
Her heart with deep delight is springing,  
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;  
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,  
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;  
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!  
All hail, incarnate Lord,  
Our crown, and our reward!
Alleluia!
We haste along, in pomp of song,
And gladsome join the marriage throng.

**3**  
Zion hears the watchmen singing,  
Her heart with deep delight is springing,  
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;  
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,  
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;  
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!  
All hail, incarnate Lord,  
Our crown, and our reward!  
Alleluia!  
We haste along, in pomp of song,  
And gladsome join the marriage throng.
