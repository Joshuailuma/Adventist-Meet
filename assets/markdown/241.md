# 241 - Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Jesus, the very thought of Thee,  
With sweetness fills my breast;  
But sweeter far Thy face to see,  
And in Thy presence rest.   
   
**2**  
No voice can sing, no heart can frame,  
Nor can the memory find  
A sweeter sound than Jesus' name,  
The Savior of mankind.  

**3**  
O hope of every contrite heart!  
O joy of all the meek,  
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!  
How good to those who seek!

**4**  
But what to those who find? Ah! this  
Nor tongue nor pen can show:   
The love of Jesus; what it is,  
None but His loved ones know. 

**5**  
Jesus, our only joy be Thou,  
As Thou our prize wilt be;  
In Thee be all our glory now,  
And through eternity.
