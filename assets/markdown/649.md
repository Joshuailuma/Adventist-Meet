-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**     
Lord, while for all mankind we pray,  
Of every clime and coast,  
O hear us for our native land,  
The land we love the most. 
  
**2**  
O guard our shores from every foe;  
With peace our borders bless;  
With prosperous times our cities crown,  
Our fields with plenteousness.

**3**   
Unite us in the sacred love  
Of knowledge, truth, and Thee,  
And let our hills and valleys shout  
The songs of liberty. 

**4**  
Lord of the nations, thus to Thee  
Our country we commend;  
Be Thou her refuge and her trust,  
Her everlasting friend.
