# 458 - More Love to Thee
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
More love to thee, O Christ, more love to thee!  
Hear thou the prayer I make on bended knee.  
This is my earnest plea:  
More love, O Christ, to thee;  
More love to thee, more love to thee!

**2**  
Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;  
Now thee alone I seek, give what is best.  
This all my prayer shall be:  
More love, O Christ, to thee;  
More love to thee, more love to thee!

**3**  
Let sorrow do its work, come grief and pain;  
sweet are thy messengers, sweet their refrain,  
when they can sing with me:  
More love, O Christ, to thee;  
More love to thee, more love to thee!

**4**  
Then shall my latest breath whisper thy praise;  
this be the parting cry my heart shall raise;  
this still its prayer shall be:  
More love, O Christ, to thee;  
More love to thee, more love to thee!
