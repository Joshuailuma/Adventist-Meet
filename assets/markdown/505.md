-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
I need the prayers of those I love,  
While trav'ling o'er life's rugged way,   
That I may true and faithful be,  
And live for Jesus every day.  


### Refrain  
I want my friends to pray for me,  
To bear my tempted soul above,  
And intercede with God for me;  
I need the prayers of those I love.  

**2**  
I need the prayers of those I love,  
To help me in each trying hour,  
To bear my tempted soul to Him,  
That He may keep me by His pow'r. 

**3**  
I want my friends to pray for me,  
To hold me up on wings of faith,  
That I may walk the narrow way,  
Kept by our Father's glorious grace.
