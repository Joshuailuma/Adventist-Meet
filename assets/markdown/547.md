-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
Be Thou my vision,  
O Lord of my heart;  
Naught be all else to me,  
Save that Thou art  
Thou my best thought, By day or by night,  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  

**2**  
Be Thou my wisdom,  
Be Thou my true word;  
I ever with Thee  
Thou with me, Lord;  
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one. 

**3**  
Riches I heed not,  
Nor man's empty praise,  
Thou mine inheritance,  
Now and always:  
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,  
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

**4**  
High King of heaven,  
When vict'ry is won,  
May I reach heaven's joys,  
O bright heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.
