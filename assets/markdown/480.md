# 480 - Dear Lord and Father
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
Dear Lord and Father of mankind,  
Forgive our foolish ways;  
Reclothe us in our rightful mind,  
In purer lives thy service find,  
In deeper reverence, praise.

**2**  
In simple trust like theirs who heard,  
Beside the Syrian sea,  
The gracious calling of the Lord,   
Let us, like them, without a word,  
Rise up and follow thee.

**3**  
O sabbath rest by Galilee,  
O calm of hills above,  
Where Jesus knelt to share with thee  
The silence of eternity,  
Interpreted by love!

**4**  
Drop thy still dews of quietness,  
Till all our strivings cease;  
Take from our souls the strain and stress,  
And let our ordered lives confess  
The beauty of thy peace.

**5**  
Breathe through the heats of our desire  
Thy coolness and thy balm;  
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;  
Speak through the earthquake, wind, and fire,  
O still, small voice of calm.
