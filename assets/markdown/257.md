# 257 - Come Down, O Love Divine
-------------------
## Key D Major


**1**  
Come down, O Love divine,  
Seek Thou this soul of mine,  
And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;  
O Comforter, draw near,  
Within my heart appear,  
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.    
   
**2**  
O let it freely burn,  
Till earthly passions turn  
To dust and ashes in its heat consuming;  
And let Thy glorious light  
Shine ever on my sight,  
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.  

**3**  
Let holy charity  
Mine outward vesture be,  
And lowliness become my inner clothing;  
True lowliness of heart  
Which takes the humbler part,  
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.  

**4**  
And so the yearning strong,  
With which the soul will long,  
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;  
For none can guess its grace,  
Till he become the place  
Where in the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.
