# 302 - Deeper Yet
-------------------
## Key A Major


**1**  
In the blood from the cross  
I have been washed from sin;  
But to be free from dross,  
Still I would enter in.


### Refrain  
Deeper yet, deeper yet,  
Into the crimson flood;  
Deeper yet, deeper yet,  
Under the precious blood.
   
**2**  
Deeper yet, deeper yet,  
Into the crimson flood;  
Deeper yet, deeper yet,  
Under the precious blood.    

**3**  
Near to Christ I would live,  
Following Him each day;  
What I ask He will give;  
So then with faith I pray.

**4**  
Now I have peace, sweet peace,  
While in this world of sin;  
But to pray I'll not cease  
Till I am pure within.
