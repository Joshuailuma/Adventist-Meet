## Key D Major


**1**    
Day by day and with each passing moment,  
Strength I find to meet my trials here;  
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,  
I've no cause for worry or for fear,  
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure  
Gives unto each day what He deems best  
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,  
Mingling toil with peace and rest.   

**2**  
Every day the Lord Himself is near me  
With a special mercy for each hour;  
All my cares he fain would bear, and cheer me,  
He whose name is Counselor and power.  
The protection of His child and treasure  
Is a charge that on Himself He laid:  
As your days, your strength shall be in measure,  
This the pledge to me He made. 

**3**  
Help me then in every tribulation  
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,  
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation  
Offered me within Thy holy Word.  
Help me Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,  
E'er to take, as from a Father's hand,  
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,  
Till I reach the promised land.
