Who is He in yonder stall,  
At whose feet the shepherds fall?  
'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,  
'Tis the Lord, the King of glory!  


### Refrain  
At His feet we humbly fall,  
Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.  
At His feet we humbly fall; the Lord of all.  
Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,  
Crown Him Lord of all.

Prays in dark Gethsemane?

Dies in shame and agony?

Rules through all the world alone?
