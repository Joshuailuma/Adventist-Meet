-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**    
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Thou art the Potter;  
I am the clay.  
Mold me and make me  
After Thy will,  
While I am waiting,  
Yielded and still.  

**2**  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Search me and try me,  
Master, today!  
Whiter than snow, Lord,  
Wash me just now,  
As in Thy presence  
Humbly I bow.  

**3**  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Wounded and weary  
Help me, I pray!  
Power; all power;  
Surely is Thine!  
Touch me and heal me,  
Savior divine!  

**4**  
Have Thine own way, Lord!  
Have Thine own way!  
Hold o'er my being  
Absolute sway!  
Fill with Thy Spirit  
Till all shall see  
Christ only, always,  
Living in me!
