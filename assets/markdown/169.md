# 169 - Come, You Faithful
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Come, you faithful, raise the strain  
Of triumphant gladness;  
God has brought His people forth  
Into joy from sadness.  
Now rejoice, Jerusalem,  
And with true affection  
Welcome in unwearied strains  
Jesus' resurrection.   
    

**2**  
'Tis the spring of souls today;  
Christ has burst His prison;  
From the frost and gloom of death  
Light and life have risen.  
All the winter of our sins,  
Long and dark, is flying  
From His light, to whom we give  
Thanks and praise undying. 

**3**  
"Alleluia!" now we cry  
To our King immortal,  
Who, triumphant, burst the bars  
Of the tomb's dark portal;  
"Alleluia!" with the Son,  
God the Father praising;  
"Alleluia!" yet again  
To the Spirit raising.
