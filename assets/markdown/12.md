**1**  
Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,  
God of glory, Lord of love;  
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,  
Hail Thee as the sun above.  
Melt the clouds of sin and darkness,  
Drive the dark of doubts away;  
Giver of immortal gladness,  
Fill us with the light of day!

**2**  
All Thy works with joy surrond Thee,  
Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,  
Stars and angels sing surround Thee,  
Center of unbroken praise;  
Field and forest, vale and mountain,  
Bloss'ming meadow, flashing sea,  
Chanting bird and flowing fountain  
Call us to rejoice in Thee.

**3**  
Thou art giving and forgiving,  
Ever blessing, ever blest,  
Well-spring of the joy of living,  
Ocean-depth of happy rest!  
Thou the Father, Christ our Brother-  
All who live in love are Thine:  
Teach us how to love each other,  
Lift us to the joy divine.
