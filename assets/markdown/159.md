# 159 - The Old Rugged Cross
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,  
The emblem of suffering and shame,  
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best  
For a world of lost sinners was slain. 


### Refrain  
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,  
Till my trophies at last I lay down;  
I will cling to the old rugged cross,  
And exchange it some day for a crown.

**2**  
Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,  
Has a wondrous attraction for me,  
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,  
To bear it to dark Calvary.    

**3**  
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,  
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;  
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,  
Where His glory forever I'll share.
