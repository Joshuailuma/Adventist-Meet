# 230 - All Glory, Laud, and Honor
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
All glory, laud, and honor  
To Thee, Redeemer, King,  
To whom the lips of children  
Made sweet hosannas ring.  
Thou art the King of Israel,  
Thou, David's royal Son,  
Who in the Lord's name comest,  
The King and Blessed One. 
   
**2**  
The company of angels  
Are praising Thee on high,  
And mortal men and all things  
Created make reply.  
The people of the Hebrews  
With palms before Thee went;  
Our praise and prayer and anthems  
Before Thee we present. 

**3**  
To Thee, before Thy passion,  
They sang their hymns of praise;  
To Thee, now high exalted,  
Our melody we raise.  
Thou didst accept their praises;  
Accept the praise we bring,  
Who in all good delightest,  
Thou good and gracious King.
