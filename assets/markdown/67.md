**1**  
O Lord, now let Your servant  
Depart in heav’nly peace,  
For I have seen the glory  
Of your redeeming grace:  
A light to lead the Gentiles  
Unto your holy hill,  
The glory of Your people,  
Your chosen Israel.

**2**      
Then grant that I may follow  
Your gleam, O glorious Light,  
Till earthly shadows scatter,  
And faith is changed to sight;  
Till raptured saints shall gather  
Upon that shining shore,  
Where Christ, the blessed Daystar,  
Shall light them evermore.
