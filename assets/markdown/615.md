# 615 - Rise Up, O Church of God
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**    
Rise up, O men of God!  
His kingdom tarries long.  
Bring in the day of brotherhood  
And end the night of wrong.    

**2**  
Let women all rise up!  
Have done with lesser things.  
Give heart and mind and soul and strength  
To serve the King of kings.  

**3**   
Rise up, courageous youth!  
The church for you doth wait,  
Her strength unequal to her task;  
Rise up, and make her great!

**4**  
Lift high the cross of Christ!  
Tread where his feet have trod.  
Disciples of the Son of Man,  
Rise up, O church of God!
