# 328 - Must Jesus Bear the Cross Alone
-------------------
## Key G Major


**1**  
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,  
And all the world go free?  
No, there's a cross for every one,  
And there's a cross for me.      
   
**2**  
The consecrated cross I'll bear,  
Till He shall set me free;  
And then go home my crown to wear,  
For there's a crown for me.  

**3**  
Upon the crystal pavement, down  
At Jesus' pierced feet,  
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,  
And His dear name repeat.
