# 564 - For Sunrise Hope and Sunset Calm
-------------------
## Key C Major


**1**    
For sunrise hope and sunset calm,  
And all that lies between,  
For all the sweetness and the balm  
That is and that has been,  
For comradeship, for peace in strife,  
And light on darkened days;  
For work to do and strength for life  
We sing our hymn of praise.

**2**  
 But O, we press far, far above  
These gifts of pure delight,  
And find in Thee, and in Thy love contentment infinite.  
O Lord, beloved, in whom are found  
All joys of time and place,  
What will it be when joy is crowned  
By vision of Thy face?
