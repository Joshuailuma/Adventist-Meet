# 375 - Work For the Night Is Coming
-------------------
## Key Eb Major


**1**  
Work, for the night is coming;  
Work through the morning hours;  
Work while the dew is sparkling;  
Work 'mid springing flowers;  
Work while the day grows brighter,  
Under the glowing sun;  
Work, for the night is coming,  
When man's work is done.  

**2**  
Work, for the night is coming;  
Work through the sunny noon;  
Fill brightest hours with labor,  
Rest comes sure and soon;  
Give every flying minute  
Something to keep in store;  
Work, for the night is coming,  
When man works no more. 

**3**  
Work, for the night is coming:  
Under the sunset skies,  
While their bright tints are glowing,  
Work for the daylight flies;  
Work till the last beam fadeth,  
Fadeth to shine no more;  
Work, for the Lord is coming,  
When man's work is o'er.
