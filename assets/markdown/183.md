# 183 - I Will Sing of Jesus' Love   
-------------------
## Key Bb Major


**1**  
I will sing of Jesus' love,  
Sing of Him who first loved me;  
For He left bright worlds above,  
And died on Calvary. 


### Refrain  
I will sing of Jesus' love,  
Endless praise my heart shall give;  
He has died that I might live;  
I will sing His love to me.  

**2**  
O the depths of love divine!  
Earth or heaven can never know  
How that sins as dark as mine  
Can be made as white as snow.    

**3**  
Nothing good for Him I've done;  
How could He such love bestow?  
Lord, I own my heart is won,  
Help me now my love to show.
