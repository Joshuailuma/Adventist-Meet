## Key Ab Major


**1**  
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;  
No tender voice like thine can peace afford.


### Refrain  
I need thee, O I need thee;  
Every hour I need thee;  
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to thee.

**2**  
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;  
Temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

**3**  
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;  
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

**4**  
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;  
And thy rich promises in me fulfill.
