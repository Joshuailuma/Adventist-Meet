# 3 - God Himself Is With Us
---------------------
## Key G Major  

**1**  
God Himself is with us;  
Let us all adore Him,  
And with awe appear before Him.  
God is here within us;  
Soul, in silence fear Him,  
Humbly, fervently draw near Him.  
Now His own who have known God,  
In worship lowly,  
Yield their spirits wholly.  

**2**  
Come, abide within me;  
Let my soul, like Mary,  
Be Thine earthly sanctuary.  
Come, in-dwelling Spirit,  
With transfigured splendor;  
Love and honor will I render,  
Where I go here below,  
Let me bow before Thee.  

**3**
Gladly we surrender  
Earth's deceitful treasures,  
Pride of life, and sinful pleasures;  
Gladly, Lord, we off Thine to be forever,  
Soul and life and each endeavour.  
Thou alone shalt be known  
Lord of all our being,  
Life's true way decreeing.
