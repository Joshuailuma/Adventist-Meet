# 205 - Gleams of the Golden Morning
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
The golden morning is fast approaching;  
Jesus soon will come  
To take His faithful and happy children  
To their promised home.   


### Refrain  
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning  
Piercing through this night of gloom!  
O, we see the gleams of the golden morning  
That will burst the tomb.

**2**  
The gospel summons will soon be carried  
To the nations round;  
The Bridegroom then will cease to tarry  
And the trumpet sound.      

**3**  
Attended by all the shining angels,  
Down the flaming sky  
The Judge will come, and will take His people  
Where they will not die.  

**4**  
There those loved ones who have long been parted,  
Will all meet that day;  
The tears of those who are broken-hearted  
Will be wiped away.
