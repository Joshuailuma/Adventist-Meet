# 322 - Nothing Between
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**  
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,  
Naught of this world's delusive dream:  
I have renounced all sinful pleasure-  
Jesus is mine!  
There's nothing between.    


### Refrain  
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,  
So that His blessed face may be seen;  
Nothing preventing the least of His favor:  
Keep the way clear!  
Let nothing between.
   
**2**  
Nothing between, like worldly pleasure:  
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,  
Must not my heart from Him ever sever-  
He is my all!  
There's nothing between.

**3**  
Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,  
Though the whole world against me convene;  
Watching with prayer and much self-denial  
Triumph at last,  
With nothing between!
