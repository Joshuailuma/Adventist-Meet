# 528 - A Shelter in the Time of Storm
-------------------
## Key F Major


**1**    
The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,  
A shelter in the time of storm;  
Secure whatever may betide,  
A shelter in the time of storm. 


### Refrain  
Mighty Rock in a weary land,  
Cooling shade on the burning sand,  
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band;   
A shelter in the time of storm.   

**2**  
A shade by day, defense by night,  
A shelter in the time of storm;  
No fears alarm, no foes affright,  
A shelter in the time of storm. 

**3**  
The raging floods may round us beat,  
A shelter in the time of storm;   
We find in God a safe retreat,  
A shelter in the time of storm. 

**4**  
O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,  
A shelter in the time of storm;  
Be Thou our helper, ever near,  
A shelter in the time of storm.
