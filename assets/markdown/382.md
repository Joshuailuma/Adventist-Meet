# 382 - O Day of Rest and Gladness
-------------------
## Key Ab Major


**1**  
O day of rest and gladness,  
O day of joy and light,  
O balm of care and sadness,  
Most beautiful, most bright;  
On thee, the high and lowly,  
Who bend before the throne,  
Sing, holy, holy, holy,  
To the Eternal One. 

**2**  
Thou art a port protected  
From storms that round us rise,  
A garden intersected  
With streams of paradise;  
Thou art a cooling fountain  
In life's dry, dreary sand;  
From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,  
We view our promised land.  

**3**  
A day of sweet reflection  
Thou art, a day of love;  
A day to raise affection  
From earth to things above.  
New graces ever gaining  
From this our day of rest  
We seek the rest remaining  
In mansions of the blest.
