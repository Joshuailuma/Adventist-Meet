**1**  
Now, Dear Lord, as we pray,  
Take our hearts and minds far away  
From the press of the world all around  
To Your throne where grace does abound.  
May our lives be transform'd by Your love,  
May our souls be refreshed from above.  
At this moment, let people everywhere  
Join us now as we come to You in prayer.
